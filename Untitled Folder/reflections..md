reflections. 
 
 
 
 
I'm really excited to read more of search inside yourself. i have read quite abit about emotional intelligence before but it's cool to hear it talked about specifically for people in the tech industry. 
 
 
I feel like meditation is something I've been putting off devoting time to for years for some reason even though I am and, always have been fully (not fully) aware of its many benefits.  
 
 
i guess it's time to reevaluate my priorities! 
 





 THE INNER CRITIC.


This is such a cool video. for some reason i have never heard anyone talk about this before. it seems so obvious yet for whatever reason people (including myself) don't understand where self defeating thoughts and ideas like the one's outlined in this video actually come from let alone how to overcome/start to overcome them.

Going to do a little more reading on the subject when i have some time.




PRIVILEGE


I think understanding and admitting your privilege is really really important. 
 
 
it's something i have been thinking about a lot especially in recent years. 
 
 
I'm not really sure what to say about it here as i myself am incredibly privileged so i don't really think it's my place to talk about it. as the video said, use your privilege to advocate for those in the rows behind you.
